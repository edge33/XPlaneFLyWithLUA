Monitors aircraft flying in your vicinity and gives an audable and visual alert.
This only works when:
- you are on approach
- you and another craft are at the same airport
- the other craft is within 5nm of that airport

Known issues

- airports in close proximity (e.g. heliports) will confuse the script. It will think aircraft are at the other airport
